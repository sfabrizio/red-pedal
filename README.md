# Guitar Red Pedal

Just a name for a keyboard arduino base that I use for swtiching preset on `guitar rig` or `rocksmith`. I also use for pause videos when I'm playing the guitar.
That's why the hardware contains 4 foot switches, Simulating keys: `1,2,3, Space` (Space for pause videos)..

btw the box of the pedal it's not even red. but it would be cool XD



# Extra Features
- Stand by, it's not always with the LEDs on.. that would be annyiong, Also will be annoying have to turn it on/off
- LED Animation when is being switch on, Just to be cool.

TODO: Yeah, It would be nice add the hardware squematics.. Some Gif showing how it looks.. but Meh, nobody cares anyway. If you need something like this, ping me.
