# Guiter Red Pedal

Just a name for a keyboard arduino base that I use for swtiching guitar rig or rocksmith presets.. I also use for pause videos whem I'm playing the guitar.
That's why the hardware contains 4 foot switches, Simulating keys: `1,2,3, Space` (Space for pause videos)..

btw the box of the pedal it's not even red. but it would be cool XD
